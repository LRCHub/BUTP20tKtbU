[00:00.02] (Birds don't, birds don't, birds don't, birds don't)
[00:26.02] 
[00:03.24] Lost in emotion, mama's youngest
[00:05.92] Tryna navigate life without my compass
[00:08.64] Some experience death and feel numbness
[00:11.31] But not me, I felt it all and couldn't function
[00:34.81] 
[00:13.94] Seeing you that day
[00:15.39] Telling you my plans but I was leaving you that day
[00:18.20] It was in God's hands, Ye was at Elon's waiting to get with me
[00:22.49] On my way to Texas, that's when Virginia hit me
[00:45.99] 
[00:25.99] And I realized in that instant
[00:28.36] Our last conversation, you was against it
[00:31.04] Told you I was going to Turks for Thanksgiving
[00:33.79] I heard what I wanted to hear but didn't listen
[00:57.29] 
[00:36.55] You said you told Gene that Bup needed forgiveness
[00:39.21] I see you went to DD's and stuffed both her fridges
[00:41.99] You even told Dad you wished y'all never splitted
[00:44.75] See, you were checking boxes, I was checking my mentions
[01:12.75] 
[00:47.62] Saying you was tired but not ready to go
[00:50.62] Basically was dying without letting me know
[00:53.44] I loved you met Nige, hate that he won't remember you
[00:56.29] Two things that break my heart is what Novembers do
[01:21.79] 
[00:59.34] And T follows you, now mind you
[01:02.09] DD calls you, Gene finds you
[01:05.05] Was that your vision?
[01:06.84] Precision, while I'm reminiscin'
[01:08.90] It all hits different, Ma, listen
[01:25.40] 
[01:11.50] The birds don't sing (yeah)
[01:13.85] The birds don't sing, they screech in pain, pain
[01:22.25] The birds don't sing (oh)
[01:25.01] The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (oh, they screech in pain)
[01:33.84] The birds don't sing
[01:36.26] The birds don't sing, they screech in pain
[01:57.26] 
[01:44.16] Your car was in the driveway, I knew you were home
[01:47.15] By the third knock, a chill ran through my bones
[01:49.70] The way you missed Mama, I guess I should've known
[01:52.66] Chivalry ain't dead, you ain't let her go alone
[02:16.16] 
[01:55.41] Found you in the kitchen, scriptures in the den
[01:58.20] Half-written texts that you never got to send
[02:01.26] Combing through your dresser drawer, where do I begin?
[02:03.88] Posting noted Bible quotes, were you preparing then?
[02:29.88] 
[02:06.57] I can hear your voice now, I can feel your presence
[02:09.63] Asking, "Should I rap again?", you gave me your blessing
[02:12.32] The way you spelled it out, there's an L in every lesson
[02:15.28] "Boy, you owe it to the world, let your mess become your message"
[02:47.78] 
[02:18.27] Shared you with my friends, the Pops they never had
[02:20.85] You lived for our fishing trips, damn, I had a dad
[02:23.86] Mine taught discipline, mine taught structure
[02:26.42] Mine didn't mind when he had to pull a double
[02:48.92] 
[02:29.16] Mine worked overtime, smiled through the struggle
[02:32.19] 'Cause mine wouldn't let us feel what he had to suffer
[02:34.86] See, mine made sure he had every base covered
[02:37.76] So imagine his pain finding base in the cupboard
[03:01.76] 
[02:40.43] Birds don't sing if the words don't sting
[02:43.45] Your last few words in my ear still ring (oh)
[02:46.40] You told me that you loved me, it was all in your tone (oh-oh)
[02:49.29] "I love my two sons" was the code to your phone, now you home
[03:19.79] 
[02:52.44] Oh, and the birds don't sing (no, they don't)
[02:55.49] The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (don't the truth ruin it?), pain (now it feels different, when they doing it)
[03:04.13] The birds don't sing (no, they don't, and they won't)
[03:06.78] The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (they don't sing, they just screech in pain), pain (it's a cycle, they do that shit over and over again)
[03:14.31] (Oh) the birds don't sing
[03:17.87] The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (all the birds they screech in pain, oh-oh)
[03:26.96] The birds don't sing
[03:28.96] The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (they'll never come back again, no, no)
[04:09.96] 
[03:40.22] Remember those who lost their mothers and fathers
[03:46.95] And make sure that every single moment that you have with them
[03:51.63] You show them love
[03:56.12] You show them love
[03:58.14] You'll see
